#Learning Journal Unit 2

#Part 1

#The volume of a sphere is 4/3πr3, where π has the value of "pi" given in Section 2.1 of your textbook. Write a function called print_volume (r) that takes an argument for the radius of the sphere, and prints the volume of the sphere.

#Call your print_volume function three times with different values for radius.

#Include all of the following in your Learning Journal:

#The code for your print_volume function.
#The inputs and outputs to three calls of your print_volume.


def print_volume(r):
    
    return print((4 / 3) * 3.14 * (r ** 3))

print_volume(1)
print_volume(2)
print_volume(3)

#Part 2
#Write your own function that illustrates a feature that you learned in this unit. 
#The function must take at least one argument. The function should be your own creation, not copied from any other source. 
#Do not copy a function from your textbook or the Internet.
